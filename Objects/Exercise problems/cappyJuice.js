/*
 *  You will be given different juices, as strings. You will also receive quantity as a number. 
 *   If you receive a juice, you already have, you must sum the current quantity of that juice,
 *    with the given one. When a juice reaches 1000 quantity, it produces a bottle. You must store 
 *    all produced bottles and you must print them at the end.
 *   Note: 1000 quantity of juice is one bottle. If you happen to have more than 1000, 
 *   you must make as much bottles as you can, and store what is left from the juice.
 *   Example: You have 2643 quantity of Orange Juice â€“ this is 2 bottles of Orange Juice 
 *   and 643 quantity left.
